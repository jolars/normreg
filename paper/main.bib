  abstract      = {
    A common step in pharmaceutical development is the formation of a quantitative
    structure-activity relationship \textasteriskcentered(QSAR) to model an exploratory series of
    compounds. A QSAR generalizes how the structure (shape) of a compound relates to its biological
    activity. A comparative study was carried out of six artificial intelligence and traditional
    algorithms for modeling QSAR's: GOLEM, CART, and MS from symbolic machine learning;
    back-propagation from neural networks; and linear regression and nearest-neighbor from
    traditional statistics. Two test case problems were studied: the inhibition of Escherichia coli
    dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by pyrimidines, and the inhibition of ratlmouse tumor DHFR by
    triazines. It was found that there was no significant statistical difference between the
    methods in terms of their ability to rank unseen compounds by activity. However, symbolic
    machine learning methods, in particular relational ones, were found to generate rules that
    provided insight into the stereochemistry of compound receptor interactions.
