\section{Summary of Data Sets}\label{sec:data-summary}

In \Cref{tab:dataset-info} we summarize the data sets we use in our paper.

\begin{table}

  \caption{Details of the real datasets used in the experiments. The median \(q\) value
    refers to the median of the proportion of ones for the binary features in the data. Note that in the case of \data{housing}, there is
    only a single binary feature.}

We also visualize the distribution of class balance among all the binary features in
\Cref{fig:data-hist-q}. We note that the class imbalance for many of these data sets is
quite severe.
