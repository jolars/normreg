\section{Summary of Data Sets}\label{sec:data-summary}

In \Cref{tab:dataset-info} we summarize the data sets we use in our paper.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Details of the real datasets used in the experiments, The median \(q\) value
    refers to the median of the proportion of ones for the binary features in the data. Note that in the case of \data{housing}, there is
    only a single binary feature.}

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We also visualize the distribution of class balance among all the binary features in
\Cref{fig:data-hist-q}. We note that the clas imbalance for these data sets is quite
severe, which is common for data sets, particularly in the high-dimensional regime.

    Histograms over the distribution of \(q\) (class balance, that is, the
    proportion of ones) for the binary features in each of the data sets
    used in the paper.
