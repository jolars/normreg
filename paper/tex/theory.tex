\section{Bias and Variance of the Elastic Net Estimator}\label{sec:theory}

% TODO: write a table of the bias and variance formulations for each type instead.

Now, assume that \(\mat{X}\) is fixed and that \(\vec{y} = \mat{X}\vec{\beta} +
\vec{\varepsilon}\), where \(\varepsilon_i\) is identically and independently distributed
noise with mean zero and finite variance \(\sigma_\varepsilon^2\). As in the previous
section, we assume that the feature vectors are orthogonal. We are interested in the
expected value of \Cref{eq:orthogonal-solution}, \(\E \hat{\beta}_j\). Let
\[
  Z = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \vec{y} = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T(\mat{X}\vec{\beta}^* + \vec{\varepsilon}) = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T (\vec{x}_j\beta_j^* + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon})
  \qquad
  \text{and}
  \qquad
  d_j = s_j(\tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \tilde{\vec{x}}_j + \lambda_2)
\]
so that \(\hat{\beta}_j = \st_{\lambda_1}(Z)/d_j\). Since \(d_j\) is fixed under our
assumptions, we will direct most of our focus towards \(S_{\lambda_1}(Z)\). First observe
that
\[
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \tilde{\vec{x}}_j & = \frac{1}{s_j^2}(\vec{x}_j - c_j)^\T (\vec{x}_j - c_j) = \frac{\vec{x}_j^\T\vec{x}_j - nc_j^2}{s^2_j} = \frac{n v_j}{s_j^2}, \\
    \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \vec{x}_j         & = \frac{1}{s_j}(\vec{x}_j^\T \vec{x}_j - \vec{x}_j^\T \ones c_j) = \frac{n v_j}{s_j},
  \end{aligned}
\]
where \(v_j\) is the uncorrected sample variance of \(\vec{x}_j\). This means that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:z-d}
  Z = \frac{\beta_j^* n v_j- \vec{x}_j^\T \vec{\varepsilon}}{s_j}
  \qquad\text{and}\qquad
  d_j = s_j\left(\frac{n v_j}{s_j^2} + \lambda_2\right).
\end{equation}
For the expected value and variance of \(Z\) we then have
\begin{align*}
  \E Z   & = \mu = \E \left( \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T (\vec{x}_j\beta_j + \vec{\varepsilon}) \right)  = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T\vec{x}_j \beta_j,      \\
  \var Z & = \sigma^2 = \var\left(\tilde{\vec{x}}_j ^\T \vec{\varepsilon}\right) = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \tilde{\vec{x}}_j\sigma_\varepsilon^2 .
\end{align*}

The expected value of the soft-thresholding estimator is
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:st-expected-value}
  \E \st_\lambda(Z) & = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \st_\lambda(z) f_Z(z) \du z                                                   \nonumber \\
                    & = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \ind{|z| > \lambda} (z -\sign(z)\lambda) f_Z(z) \du z                         \nonumber \\
                    & = \int_{-\infty}^{-\lambda}(z + \lambda)f_Z(z) \du z + \int_{\lambda}^\infty (z - \lambda)f_Z(z) \du z.
\end{align*}
And then the bias of \(\hat\beta_j\) with respect to the true coefficient \(\beta_j^*\) is
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:betahat-bias}
  \E \hat\beta_j - \beta_j^* = \frac{1}{d_j}\E \st_\lambda(Z) - \beta^*_j.
\end{equation*}

Finally, we note that the variance of the soft-thresholding estimator is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:st-variance}
  \var {S_\lambda(Z)} = \int_{-\infty}^{-\lambda}(z + \lambda)^2f_Z(z) \du z + \int_{\lambda}^\infty (z - \lambda)^2 f_Z(z) \du z - \left(\E \st_\lambda(Z)\right)^2
\end{equation}
and that the variance of the elastic net estimator is therefore
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:betahat-variance}
  \var \hat\beta_j = \frac{1}{d_j^2} \var \st_\lambda(Z).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Normally Distributed Noise}

Next, we add the additional assumption that \(\vec{\varepsilon}\) is normally distributed.
Then
\[
  Z \sim \normal\left(\mu = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T\vec{x}_j \beta_j, \sigma^2 = \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T\tilde{\vec{x}}_j \sigma_\varepsilon^2 \right).
\]
Let \(\theta = -\mu -\lambda_1 \) and \(\gamma = \mu - \lambda_1\). Then the expected value
of soft-thresholding of \(Z\) is
\begin{align}
  \E \st_{\lambda_1}(Z) & = \int_{-\infty}^\frac{\theta}{\sigma} (\sigma u - \theta) \pdf(u) \du u + \int_{-\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}}^\infty (\sigma u + \gamma) \pdf(u) \du u                                               \nonumber                      \\
                        & = -\theta \cdf\left(\frac{\theta}{\sigma}\right) - \sigma \pdf\left(\frac{\theta}{\sigma}\right) + \gamma \cdf\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}\right) + \sigma \pdf\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}\right) \label{eq:mean-centered-eval}
\end{align}
where \(\pdf(u)\) and \(\cdf(u)\) are the probability density and cumulative distribution functions of the standard normal distribution, respectively.

Next, we consider what the variance of the elastic net estimator looks like. Starting with
the first term on the left-hand side of \Cref{eq:st-variance}, we have
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:mc-var-part1}
  \int_{-\infty}^{-\lambda_1}(z+ \lambda_1)^2 f_Z(z) \du z & = \sigma^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\frac{\theta}{\sigma}} y^2 \pdf(y) \du y + 2 \theta \sigma \int_{-\infty}^{\frac{\theta}{\sigma}} y \pdf(y) \du y + \theta^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\frac{\theta}{\sigma}} \pdf(y) \du y                                                                               \nonumber \\
                                                           & = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \left( \erf\left(\frac{\theta}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\right) - \frac{\theta}{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{\theta^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) + 1 \right) + 2 \theta \sigma \pdf \left(\frac{\theta}{\sigma}\right) + \theta^2 \cdf\left(\frac{\theta}{\sigma}\right).
\end{align}
Similar computations for the second term on the left-hand side of \Cref{eq:st-variance} yield
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mc-var-part2}
  \int_{\lambda_1}^{\infty}(z - \lambda_1)^2 f_Z(z) \du z = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \left( \erf\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\right) - \frac{\gamma}{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) + 1 \right) + 2 \gamma \sigma \pdf \left(\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}\right) + \gamma^2 \cdf\left(\frac{\gamma}{\sigma}\right).
\end{equation}
Plugging \Cref{eq:mean-centered-eval,eq:mc-var-part1,eq:mc-var-part2} into \Cref{eq:betahat-variance} yields the variance of the estimator. Consequently, we can also compute the mean-squared error via the bias-variance decomposition
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:betahat-mse}
  \mse (\hat\beta_j, \beta^*_j) = \var\hat\beta_j + \left(\E \hat\beta_j - \beta^*_j\right)^2.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Binary Features}\label{sec:theory-binary-features}

The main focus in this paper is the case when \(\vec{x_j}\) is a binary feature with class
balance \(q = \bar{\vec{x}}_j\), that is, \(x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}\) for all \(i\) and
\(\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} = nq\). In this case, inserting \(v_j = (q - q^2)\) (the uncorrected
sample variance for a binary feature) into \Cref{eq:z-d}, we have
\[
  Z = \frac{\beta_j^* n(q - q^2) - \vec{x}_j^\T \vec{\varepsilon}}{s_j}
  ,\qquad
  d_j = s_j\left(\frac{n(q - q^2)}{s_j^2} + \lambda_2\right),
\]

% \[
%   \begin{aligned}
%     \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \tilde{\vec{x}}_j & = \frac{1}{s_j^2}(\vec{x}_j - \ones c_j)^\T (\vec{x}_j - \ones c_j) = \frac{1}{s^2_j}(nq - 2nq^2 + nq^2) = \frac{nq(1-q)}{s^2_j}, \\
%     \tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\T \vec{x}_j         & = \frac{1}{s_j}(\vec{x}_j^\T \vec{x}_j - \vec{x}_j^\T \ones c_j) = \frac{nq(1 - q)}{s_j}.
%   \end{aligned}
% \]
and consequently
\[
  \mu = \frac{\beta^*_j n(q - q^2)}{s_j}\qquad \text{and} \qquad \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma_\varepsilon^2n(q - q^2)}{s^2_j}.
\]
We will allow ourselves to abuse notation and overload the definitions of \(\mu\),
\(\sigma^2\), and \(d_j\) as functions of \(q\). Then, an expression for the expected value
of the elastic net estimate with respect to \(q\) can be obtained by plugging in \(\mu\)
and \(\sigma\) into \Cref{eq:mean-centered-eval}.

The presence of the factor \(q - q^2\) in \(\mu\), \(\sigma^2\), and \(d_j\) means that
there is a relationship between class balance and the elastic net estimator and that this
relationship is mediated by the scaling factor \(s_j\). To achieve some initial intuition
for this relationship, we begin by considering the noiseless case (\(\sigma_\varepsilon =
0\)) in which, inserting \(\mu\) and \(d_j\) into \Cref{eq:orthogonal-solution} yields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:noiseless-estimator}
  \hat{\beta}_j = \frac{\st_{\lambda_1}(\tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\intercal \vec{y})}{s_j\left(\tilde{\vec{x}}_j^\intercal \tilde{\vec{x}}_j + \lambda_2\right)}
  =
  \frac{\st_{\lambda_1}\left(\frac{\beta_j^* n (q - q^2)}{s_j}\right)}{s_j\left(\frac{n(q - q^2)}{s_j^2} + \lambda_2\right)}.
\end{equation}
This expression shows that the class balance, \(q\), directly affects the estimator. For values of \(q\) close to \(0\) or \(1\), the input into the soft-thresholding part of the estimator will diminish and consequently force the estimate to zero, that is, unless we use the scaling factor \(s_j = (q - q^2)\), in which case the soft-thresholding part will be unaffected by class imbalance. This choice will not, however, mitigate the impact of class imbalance on the ridge part of the estimator, for which we would instead need \(s_j = \sqrt{q - q^2}\). For any other choices of \(\delta\), such as \(\delta = 0\), \(q\) will affect the estimator through both the ridge and lasso parts, which means that there exists no scaling \(s\) that will mitigate the bias in this case. Later on, in \Cref{sec:weighted-elasticnet}, we will show how to mitigate this issue for the elastic net by scaling the coefficients in the penalty term. Bur for now, we will continue to focus on case of normalization.

Based on these facts, we will consider the scaling parameterization \(s_j =
(q-q^2)^\delta\), \(\delta \geq 0\). This includes the cases that we are primarily
interested in, that is, \(\delta = 0\) (no scaling), \(\delta = 1/2\) (standard-deviation
scaling), and \(\delta = 1\) (variance scaling). Note that the last of these types,
variance scaling, is not a standard type of normalization; yet, as we have already seen, it
has some interesting properties in the context of binary features.

Another interesting fact about \Cref{eq:noiseless-estimator}, which holds also in the noisy
situation, is that even when the binary feature is balanced (\(q = 1/2\)), normalization
will still have an effect on the estimator. Using \(\delta = 0\), for instance, leads the
true coefficient \(\beta_j^*\) in the input to \(\st_\lambda\) to be scaled by \(n (q -
q^2) = n/4\). For \(\delta = 1\), there would be, in contrast, be no scaling in the
class-balanced case. And for \(\delta = 1/2\), the scaling factor is \(n/2\). Generalizing
this, we see that to achieve equivalent scaling in the class-balanced case for all types of
normalization, under our parameterization, we would need to use
\[
  s_j = 4^{\delta - 1} (q - q^2)^\delta.
\]
This only resolves the issue for the lasso. To achieve a similar effect for ridge
regression, we would need another (but similar) modification. Since all features are binary
under our current assumptions, however, we will for now just assume that we scale
\(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) to account for this effect,\footnote{We do this in all of
  the following examples.} which is equivalent to modifying \(s_j\). We will return to this
issue later in \Cref{sec:mixed-data} where we consider mixes of binary and normally
distributed features in, in which case this has significant implications.

% TODO: This makes it seem like it would make more sense to adjust λ instead of the scaling parameter to compensate for class balance.

We now leave the noise-less scenario and proceed to consider how class balance affects the
probability of selection, bias, and variance of the elastic net estimator, starting with
the first of these. A consequence of the normal error distribution and consequent normal
distribution of \(Z\) is that the probability of selection in the elastic net problem is
given analytically by
\begin{align*}
  \Pr\left(\hat{\beta}_j \neq 0\right) & = \Pr\left(\st_{\lambda_1}(Z) \neq 0\right)                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\
                                       & = \Pr\left(Z > \lambda_1\right) + \Pr\left(Z < -\lambda_1\right)                                                                                                                                                                                          \\
                                       & = \cdf\left(\frac{\mu - \lambda_1}{\sigma}\right) + \cdf\left(\frac{- \mu -\lambda_1}{\sigma}\right)                                                                                                                                                      \\
                                       & = \cdf \left( \frac{\beta_j^*n (q-q^2)^{1/2} - \lambda_1(q-q^2)^{\delta - 1/2}}{\sigma_\varepsilon \sqrt{n}}\right)                 + \cdf \left( \frac{-\beta_j^*n (q-q^2)^{1/2} - \lambda_1(q-q^2)^{\delta - 1/2}}{\sigma_\varepsilon \sqrt{n}}\right).
\end{align*}

Letting \(\theta = -\mu - \lambda_1 \) and \(\gamma = \mu - \lambda_1\), we can express the
probability of selection in the limit as \(q \rightarrow 1^+\) as
\[
  \lim_{q \rightarrow 1^+} \Pr(\hat{\beta}_j \neq 0) =
  \begin{cases}
    0                                                                & \text{if } 0 \leq \delta < \frac{1}{2}, \\
    2\cdf\left(-\frac{\lambda_1}{\sigma_\varepsilon \sqrt{n}}\right) & \text{if } \delta = \frac{1}{2},        \\
    1                                                                & \text{if } \delta > \frac{1}{2}.
  \end{cases}
\]

In \Cref{fig:selection-probability}, we plot this probability for various settings of
\(\delta\) for a single feature. Our intuition from the noise-less case holds: \(\delta\)
mitigates the influence of class imbalance on selection probability. The lower the value of
\(\delta\), the larger the effect of class imbalance becomes. Note that the probability of
selection initially decreases also in the case when \(\delta \geq 1\). This is a
consequence of increased variance of \(Z\) dues to the scaling factor that scales the
measurement noise \(\sigma_\varepsilon^2\) upwards. Then, as \(q\) approaches 1, the
probability picks up again and eventually approaches 1 for these \(\delta \in \{1, 1.5\}\).
The reason for this is that the variance of \(Z\) eventually explodes (again due to the
scaling), which ultimately removes the soft-thresholding effect altogether. Note that the
selection probability is unaffected by \(\lambda_2\) (the ridge penalty), so these results
hold for any value of it.

\end{figure}

Now we turn to the impact of class imbalance on bias and variance of the elastic net
estimator. We begin, in \Cref{thm:classbalance-bias}, by considering the expected value of
the elastic net estimator in the limit as \(q \rightarrow 1^+\).

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:classbalance-bias}
  If \(\vec{x}_j\) is a binary feature with class balance \(q \in (0, 1)\), \(\lambda_1 \in (0,\infty)\), \(\lambda_2 \in [0,\infty)\), \(\sigma_\varepsilon > 0\), and \(s_j = (q - q^2)^{\delta}\), \(\delta \geq 0\)  then
  \[
    \lim_{q \rightarrow 1^+} \E \hat{\beta}_j =
    \begin{cases}
      0                                                                                                  & \text{if } 0 \leq \delta < \frac{1}{2}, \\
      \frac{2n \beta_j^*}{n + \lambda_2} \cdf\left(-\frac{\lambda_1}{\sigma_\varepsilon \sqrt{n}}\right) & \text{if } \delta = \frac{1}{2},        \\
      \beta^*_j                                                                                          & \text{if } \delta > \frac{1}{2}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{theorem}

% \begin{remark}[Ridge Regression]

% \end{remark}

\Cref{thm:classbalance-bias} shows that the bias of the elastic net estimator when \(0 \leq \delta < 1/2\) approaches
\(-\beta_j^*\) as \(q \rightarrow 1^+\). Interestingly, when \(\delta = 1/2\) (standardization), the estimate does not in fact tend to zero. Instead, it approaches the
true coefficient scaled by the probability that a standard normal variable is smaller than \(\beta_j^*\sqrt{n}\sigma_\varepsilon^{-1}\). For \(\delta > 1/2\), the
estimate is unbiased asymptotically, which is related to the scaled variance of the error term. Note that this unbiasedness is paralleled by a surge in variance and therefore also a rise in mean-squared error, and only serves to demonstrate that the cost of the decoupling of \(q\) is unbearable in the large noise--large imbalance scenario.
In \Cref{thm:classbalance-variance}, we continue by studying the variance in the limit as \(q \rightarrow 1^+\).

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:classbalance-variance}
  If \(\vec{x}_j\) is a binary feature with class balance \(q \in (0, 1)\) and \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \in (0,\infty)\), \(\sigma_\varepsilon > 0\), and \(s_j = (q - q^2)^{\delta}\), \(\delta \geq 0\), then
  \[
    \lim_{q \rightarrow 1^+} \var \hat{\beta}_j =
    \begin{cases}
      0      & \text{if } 0 \leq \delta < \frac{1}{2}, \\
      \infty & \text{if } \delta \geq \frac{1}{2}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Variance in Ridge Regression]
  \label{cor:ridge-variance}
  Assume the conditions of \Cref{thm:classbalance-variance} hold, except that \(\lambda_1 = 0\). Then
  \[
    \lim_{q \rightarrow 1^+} \var \hat{\beta}_j =
    \begin{cases}
      0                                          & \text{if } 0 \leq \delta < 1/4, \\
      \frac{\sigma_\varepsilon^2 n}{\lambda_2^2} & \text{if } \delta = 1/4,        \\
      \infty                                     & \text{if } \delta > 1/4.
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{corollary}

\Cref{thm:classbalance-variance} formally proves the asymptotic variance effects of our scaling parameter \(s_j\) which we have already discussed in the context of selection probability and bias. Taken together with the results from \Cref{thm:classbalance-bias}, this suggests that the choice of scaling parameter, at least in the case of our specific parameterization, introduces a bias--variance tradeoff with respect to \(\delta\): to reduce bias (with respect to \(q\)), we need to pay the cost of increased variance.

In \Cref{fig:bias-var-onedim-lasso}, we now visualize bias, variance, and mean-squared
error for ranges of class balance and various noise-level settings for a lasso problem. The
figure demonstrates the bias--variance tradeoff that our asymptotic results suggested and
indicates that the optimal choice of \(\delta\) is related to the noise level in the data.
Since this level is unknown for most data sets, it suggests there might be value in
selecting \(\delta\) through hyper-optimization as is typically done for the other
hyper-parameters in the elastic net \((\lambda_1, \lambda_2)\)

So far, we have only considered a single binary feature. But under the assumption of
orthogonal features, it is straightforward to introduce multiple binary features. In a
first example, we study how the power of correctly detecting \(k=10\) signals under \(q\)
linearly spaced in \([0.5, 0.99]\)~(\Cref{fig:binary-power}). We set \(\beta^*_j = 2\) for
each of the signals, use \(n = 100\,000\), and let \(\sigma_\varepsilon = 1\). The level of
regularization is set to \(\lambda_1 = n 4^\delta/10\). As we can see, the power is
directly related to \(q\) and for unbalanced features stronger the higher the choice of
\(\delta\) is.

We also consider a version of the same setup, but with \(p\) linearly spaced in \([20,
    100]\) to compute the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) and false discovery rate
(FDR)~(\Cref{fig:binary-fdr-mse}). As before, we let \(k = 10\) and consider three
different levels of class imbalance. The remaining \(p-k\) features have class balances
spaced evenly on a logarithmic scale from 0.5 to 0.99. Unsurprisingly, the increase in
power gained from selecting \(\delta = 1\) imposes increased false discovery rates. The
mean-squared error depends on the class balance. For class-balanced signals, \(\delta \in
\{0, 1/2\}\) proves to b the best choice, while for unbalanced signals, \(\delta = 1\) is
the best choice. In the case when \(q = 0.99\), the model under scaling with \(\delta = 0\)
is altogether unable to detect any of the true signals, instead picking up on the noisy,
but better-balanced, features.

In \Cref{sec:experiments}, we will continue to study binary features in simulated
experiments. For now, however, we will turn to the case of mixed data.

\subsection{Weighted Elastic Net}\label{sec:weighted-elasticnet}

We have so far shown that certain choices of scaling can mitigate the class-balance bias
imposed by the lasso and ridge regression. But we have also demonstrated that there is no
choice of scaling in the case of the elastic net that can achieve the same effect.
\Cref{eq:noiseless-estimator}, however, suggests a natural alternative to normalization,
which is to introduce feature-wise weights in the penalty term. In
\Cref{eq:noiseless-estimator}, this would entail setting \(s_j=1\) and multiplying
\(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) with \(s_j\). Formally, we transform the objective function
\(f\) in \Cref{eq:elastic-net} into
\[
  \tilde{f}(\beta_0, \vec{\beta}, \mat{X}, \vec{y}, \lambda_1, \lambda_2) =
  \frac{1}{2} \lVert \vec{y} - \beta_0 - \mat{X}\vec{\beta}\rVert_2^2 + \lambda_1 \sum_{j=1}^p u_j |\beta_j| + \frac{\lambda_2}{2} \sum_{j=1}^p v_j \beta_j^2,
\]
with \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) being \(p\)-length vectors of positive scaling factors. We
call this for the \emph{weighted elastic net}, wich is equivalent to the original form when
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:weighted-normal-equivalence}
  \vec{u} = \diag\left(\mat{S}^{-1}\right), \qquad \text{and}\qquad \vec{v} = \diag\left(\mat{S}^{-2}\right),
\end{equation}
which can be seen by substituting \(\mat{S}\vec{\beta} = \tilde{\vec{\beta}}\) in the original objective formulation.
With this alternative formulation, we can can control class-balance bias by setting
\[
  u_j = v_j = (q - q^2)^{\delta},
\]
and counteract it, at least in the noiseless case, with \(\delta = 1\) as before. This
alternative mitigates the need to normalize the design matrix altogether (since the
locations of the features are inconsequential with respect to the resulting model
coefficients as long as we include an intercept). This is the approach we will therefore
take in the following sections, but stress that there is no difference in results between
the two approaches as far as the lasso and ridge regression are concerned. Note, however,
that the effect of \(\delta\) is is only comparable between the two approaches for the
particular choice of \(\vec{u}\) and \(\vec{v}\) given in
\Cref{eq:weighted-normal-equivalence}.

Finally, note that the estimated coefficients from the weighted elastic net are on the same
scale as the original (non-normalized data), so there is no need to rescale the
coefficients in the weighted elastic net.

\subsection{Mixed Data}\label{sec:mixed-data}

In this section, we consider the case where the features are made up of a mix of continuous
and and binary features. Throughout the section, we will continue to assume that
\(\mat{X}\) is fixed and that the features are orthogonal to one another. As in our
theoretical results, we will also restrict our focus to the case where the continuous
features are normally distributed.

A fundamental problem in the context of mixed data is how to put the binary and normal
features on the same scale, which we need to do in order for regularization to be, roughly
speaking, ``fair'', given that the solution is sensitive to the scale of the features. In
essence, we need to say something about how an effect associated with a one-unit change in
the binary feature (a flip) relates to a one-unit change in the continuous feature. Since
we assume our continuous feature to be normal, however, we will instead reason about change
in terms of standard deviations of the normal feature.

To setup this situation more formally, we will say that the effect of a binary feature
\(\vec{x}_1\) and a normal feature \(\vec{x}_2\) are \emph{comparable} if
\[
  \beta^*_1 = \kappa \sigma_{2}\beta^*_2,
\]
where \(\sigma_2\) is the standard deviation of \(\vec{x}_2\) and \(\kappa > 0\) is a
scaling factor that represents the number of standard deviations (of the continuous
feature) we consider achieves comparability between the features' effects. (Note that
\(\sigma_2 \beta_2^*\) is just the standardized coefficient for the normal feature.) We
illustrate this notion of comparability by the following examples.

\begin{example}
  Assume \(\kappa = 2\). If \(\vec{x}_2\) is sampled from \(\normal(\mu, 1/2^2)\), then the effects of \(\vec{x}_1\) and \(\vec{x}_2\) are comparable if \(\beta_1^* = \beta_2^*\).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Assume \(\kappa = 1\). If \(\vec{x}_2\) is sampled from \(\normal(\mu, 2^2)\), then the effects of \(\vec{x}_1\) and \(\vec{x}_2\) are comparable if \(\beta_1^* = 2\beta_2^*\).
\end{example}

Note that this definition refers to the data-generating mechanism, and not the regularized
estimates. What we ultimately want for comparability, however, is for the following
relationship to hold:
\[
  \hat{\beta}_1 = \kappa \sigma_{2}\hat{\beta}_2.
\]
Put plainly, we want the effects of regularization to be distributed evenly across the
estimates. The crux of the problem is how to choose the scaling factor \(s_j\) for the
binary features in order to achieve this effect for a given \(\kappa\). Let us assume that
we have two features, \(\vec{x}_1\) and \(\vec{x}_2\), where \(\vec{x}_1\) is binary and
\(\vec{x}_2\) is normally distributed and that their effects are comparable in the sense
given above. We assume that we use standardization for the normal feature, or equivalently
\(u_j = \sigma\) and \(v_j = \sigma^2\). Then it should hold that
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \label{eq:comparable-effects}
  \hat{\beta}_1                                                                                                                      & = \kappa \sigma_2\hat{\beta}_2                                                                                         & \implies \nonumber \\
  \frac{\st_{u_1\lambda_1}(\vec{x}_1^\intercal \vec{y})}{\left(\vec{x}_1^\intercal \vec{x}_1 + v_1 \lambda_2\right)}                 & = \frac{\kappa \sigma_2 \st_{u_2\lambda_1}(\vec{x}_2^\intercal \vec{y})}{\vec{x}_2^\intercal \vec{x}_2 + v_2\lambda_2} & \implies \nonumber \\
  \frac{\st_{u_1\lambda_1}(\vec{x}_1^\intercal \vec{x}_1 \hat{\beta}_1)}{\left(\vec{x}_1^\intercal \vec{x}_1 + v_1 \lambda_2\right)} & = \frac{\kappa \sigma_2 \st_{\sigma\lambda_1}(n\sigma^2 \hat{\beta}_2)}{n \sigma^2 + \sigma^2\lambda_2}                & \implies \nonumber \\
  \frac{\st_{u_1\lambda_1}\left(n\hat{\beta}_1 (q - q^2)\right)}{n(q - q^2) + v_1\lambda_2}                                          & = \frac{\kappa \st_{\lambda_1}\left(\frac{n\hat{\beta}_1}{\kappa} \right)}{n + \lambda_2}.
\end{alignat}
We observe that \Cref{eq:comparable-effects} holds if \(u_1 = \kappa (q - q^2)\) and \(v_1 = (q - q^2)\).
In other words, we can achieve comparability in the lasso part by scaling each coefficient in the lasso penalty term with the corresponding coefficient's variance times \(\kappa\), the number of standard deviations we consider achieves comparability between the features' effects, and in the ridge part by scaling the squared coefficients with standard deviation (irrespective of \(\kappa\)).

For other choices of \(u_1\) and \(v_1\), including \(u_1, v_1 \propto (q-q^2)^\delta\),
equality can only hold for a specific level of class balance. If we let this level be
\(q_0\), then, to achieve equality we need \(u_1 =\kappa (q_0 - q_0^2)^{1 - \delta}(q -
q^2)^\delta\) and \(v_1 = (q_0 - q_0^2)^{1 - 2\delta} (q - q^2)^\delta\). In the sequel, we
will assume that \(q_0 = 1/2\), to have effects be equivalent for the class-balanced case.

Note that this also means that there is an implicit relationship between the strength of
penalization for binary and normal features, which depends on the level of class balance
and normalization type. This means, for instance, that even in the class-balanced case (\(q
= 1/2\)), we have to account for the type of normalization if we want binary and normal
features to be treated equally. For example, if we were to use \(\delta=0\) and fit the
lasso, then \Cref{eq:comparable-effects} for a binary feature with \(q=1/2\) becomes
\[
  \frac{4\st_{\lambda_1}\left(\frac{n\beta_1^*}{4}\right)}{n}               = \frac{\kappa \st_{\lambda_1}\left(\frac{n\beta_1^*}{\kappa} \right)}{n},
\]
which then implies \(\kappa = 4\), which may or may not agree with our assumptions about
comparability between these features' effects.

For the rest of this paper, we will use \(\kappa = 2\). That is, we will say that the
effects are comparable if the effect of a flip in the binary feature equals the effect of a
two-standard deviation change in the normal feature. We base this argument on the
discussion by \citet{gelman2008}, who argues that the classical approach of comparing
standardized coefficients\footnote{Coefficients multiplied by the standard deviation of the
  respective feature.} awards effects of continuous features undue strength for most real
data, since a change from, for instance, the lower to the upper 16\% of the distribution
will equal approximately twice the effect of a change in the binary feature. Using two
standard deviations as a comparability factor would, in contrast, equivocate this change
with the flip of the binary feature, which we believe is a better default. We want to
stress that the choice of \(\kappa\) should, if possible, in general be made on a
case-by-case (feature-by-feature) basis, using all available knowledge about the data at
hand. But, irrespective of this, we also want to emphasize that the choice should be made.
If you do not make it explicitly, then it will be implicitly dictated through the
combination of normalization and penalization types you use.

Finally, note that the reasoning of comparability above rests on the assumption of no
noise. And we are, in fact, in general instead more interested in the expected value of the
estimators, which depend on the noise level. In the case of large class-imbalances and
large noise, for instance, our previous results (see \Cref{fig:bias-var-onedim-lasso} for
instance), suggest that the estimators for normally distributed and binary features will
not be comparable in this case.
