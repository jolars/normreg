Many regularized methods, such as the lasso and ridge regression, are sensitive to the
scales of the features in the data. As a consequence, it has become standard practice to
normalize (center and scale) features such that they share the same scale. For continuous
data, the most common strategy is standardization: centering and scaling each feature by
its mean and and standard deviation, respectively. For binary data, especially when it is
high-dimensional and sparse, the most common strategy, however, is to not scale at all. In
this paper, we show that this choice has dramatic effects for the estimated model in the
case when the binary features are imbalanced and that these effects, moreover, depend on
the type regularization (lasso or ridge) used. In particular, we demonstrate the size of a
feature's corresponding coefficient in the lasso is directly related to its class imbalance
and that this effect depends on the normalization used. We suggest possible remedies for
this problem and also discuss the case when data is mixed, that is, contains both
continuous and binary features.
