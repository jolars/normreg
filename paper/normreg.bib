    Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs.
    One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each
    numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric
    variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is
    with inputs equal to the mean \pm{}1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients
    are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have
    implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two
    simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data
    from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on
    the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling
    as a default option--an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables
    in whatever way they are coded in the data file--so that the magnitudes of
    coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.
